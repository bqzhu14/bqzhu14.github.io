I am an instructor at Department of Mathematics, Princeton University.

I'm interested in Number theory, especially arithmetic intersection theory and its relation to analytic objects like L-functions. Currently I am studying special cycles and related topics on Shimura varieties and Rapoport--Zink spaces. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.
